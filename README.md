# DL_onevarfunc
Deep learning model for one variable real functions.

Here, I show how a very simple deep learning architecture can be trained to model distinct one variable real functions. I use pytorch, but it is very easy to do the same in keras or tensorflow. This is a good way for startes to familiarize with DL libraries.
